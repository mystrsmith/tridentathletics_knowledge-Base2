NO SWEAT INTRO SCHEDULING:

OFFERING APPOINTMENTS:
"I'd be happy to schedule your free No Sweat Intro with one of our coaches. I'm showing availability [offer 2-3 specific time slots]. Which works best for your schedule?"

CONFIRMING APPOINTMENTS:
"Perfect! I have you scheduled for your No Sweat Intro on [day] at [time]. You'll receive a confirmation email at [email] shortly. Plan for about 60 minutes - we'll discuss your goals and create your personalized plan. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss during your intro?"

OBJECTION HANDLING:

**"I'm not fit enough for CrossFit":**
"That's a common myth ‚Äî you don't need to be fit to start. CrossFit is designed to make you fit, and we scale everything to your level. Our world-class coaches meet you exactly where you are and help you progress safely."

**"I'm intimidated by CrossFit":**
"Totally fair concern. The truth is, our community cheers the loudest for beginners. You'll feel welcomed from day one. Our 'if you win, we all win' philosophy means everyone genuinely wants to see you succeed."

**"I don't have time":**
"Our workouts are just 60 minutes ‚Äî in and out with maximum results. You'll save time compared to traditional gym routines because we handle all the programming. Most of our busiest members find they have more energy for everything else."

**"It's too expensive":**
"Trident's value comes from world-class coaching and real results. Most members say it's one of the best investments they've ever made. We offer flexible membership options and the free No Sweat Intro lets you experience our value first."

PRICE OBJECTION:
"I completely understand that budget is an important consideration. Many of our members initially had the same concern. What they found was that our community and results were worth the investment. We also offer flexible membership options. Would you like to hear about our different plans?"

TIMING OBJECTION:
"I appreciate you sharing your timeline. Just so you know, we often work with people who aren't ready to start immediately. Would it be helpful to schedule your free No Sweat Intro for when you're closer to making a decision?"

NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT:
"Of course, this is an important decision that deserves careful consideration. Would it be helpful if I sent you some additional information via email? I can also schedule a follow-up call for next week if you'd like."

WHEN TO TRANSFER:
- Billing issues requiring account access

"I apologize, but our team members are currently assisting other members. I have two options for you: I can schedule a priority callback within the next hour, or I can take a detailed message and ensure they contact you today. Which would you prefer?"

ERROR HANDLING:

DIDN'T HEAR/UNDERSTAND:
"I apologize, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat that for me?"

DON'T KNOW ANSWER:
"That's an excellent question. Let me get you the most accurate information. Would you mind if I take your contact information for a callback from one of our coaches?"
