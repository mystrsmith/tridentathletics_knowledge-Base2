NO SWEAT INTRO INFORMATION:

**What is a No Sweat Intro?**
A No Sweat Intro is exactly what it sounds like — a pressure-free conversation where you meet with one of our world-class coaches to talk about your goals, tour our facility, and explore how Trident can help. No workout, no pressure, no sweat.

**What Happens:**
- 15-minute facility tour — see the space and equipment
- 30–45 minutes of conversation — about your background, goals, and challenges
- Personalized recommendations — based on your fitness level and schedule
- Next steps — only if you're ready; zero sales pressure
