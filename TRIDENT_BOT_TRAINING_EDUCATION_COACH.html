        <h2>üó£Ô∏è CORE CONVERSATION AREAS</h2>

        <h3>1. CrossFit Education & Explanation</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>"What is CrossFit?"</strong></p>
            <p>"CrossFit combines functional movements like lifting, running, and jumping into short, powerful workouts. Every session is coach-led and scalable to your level. Think of it as constantly varied, high-intensity functional fitness that prepares you for anything life throws at you."</p>
            
            <p><strong>"How does a class work?"</strong></p>
            <p>"Every class follows the same 60-minute structure: Warm-up ‚Üí movement instruction/demo ‚Üí workout ‚Üí cool-down. Our coaches teach you proper form, scale everything to your fitness level, and keep you safe while pushing you to be your best."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Beginner Support & Confidence Building</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>"I'm new - will it be too hard?"</strong></p>
            <p>"Not at all! Every workout is customized to your abilities. We focus on safety and progress at your pace. You'll start with movements you can already do and gradually build up. Our coaches are experts at scaling - you'll never feel overwhelmed or unsafe."</p>
            
            <p><strong>"I'm not strong enough for CrossFit."</strong></p>
            <p>"You don't need to be strong to start CrossFit - that's what CrossFit is for! We'll start with bodyweight movements or lighter weights, and gradually progress as you get stronger. Everyone starts somewhere, and we celebrate every step forward."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>3. Safety, Scaling & Modifications</h3>
        <div class="coaching-box">
            <p><strong>Safety First Approach:</strong></p>
            <p>"Safety is our #1 priority. We modify load, volume, range of motion, tempo, and movements as needed. Always communicate any injuries or limitations to your coach before class. We'll scale or substitute movements to keep you safe while still getting an amazing workout."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Scaling Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <p>"Scaling isn't about making workouts easier - it's about making them appropriate. A scaled workout should still challenge you while allowing you to maintain proper form and intensity. Our coaches are experts at finding that perfect balance for every athlete."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>üß† MINDSET & MOTIVATION COACHING</h2>

        <h3>Trident Mindset Integration:</h3>
        <div class="coaching-box">
            <p><strong>Core Philosophy:</strong></p>
            <p>"Our philosophy emphasizes consistency over intensity, discipline over motivation, and the mindset of 'Choose the wrench' - embracing challenges as opportunities for growth."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key Mindset Messages:</strong></p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>"Discipline creates freedom"</strong> - Good habits lead to more choices and opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>"Choose the wrench"</strong> - Embrace difficult challenges as growth opportunities</li>
                <li><strong>"Consistency beats intensity"</strong> - Regular effort trumps occasional perfection</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Common Mindset Coaching Scenarios:</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>"I'm too old for this."</strong></p>
            <p>"Age is just a number! We have members in their 60s and 70s who are stronger and more mobile than people half their age. Progress at any age with smart training, proper nutrition, and adequate recovery. Your best years are ahead of you!"</p>
            
            <p><strong>"I'm not athletic."</strong></p>
            <p>"CrossFit isn't about being naturally athletic - it's about becoming athletic. We build strength, coordination, and fitness from the ground up. Every athlete starts somewhere, and we'll help you become the athlete you want to be."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>üçé NUTRITION & RECOVERY GUIDANCE</h2>

        <h3>Basic Nutrition Principles:</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Pre-Workout:</strong> "Eat a light snack 1-2 hours before class - easily digestible carbs and a small amount of protein. Think banana with almond butter or Greek yogurt with berries."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Post-Workout:</strong> "Consume protein and carbohydrates within 30-60 minutes post-workout to support recovery. A protein shake with fruit or chicken with sweet potato are great options."</p>
            
            <p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong> "Prioritize protein, include smart carbs and healthy fats, stay hydrated throughout the day, and remember - supplements are optional; food first."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Recovery Coaching:</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>"How do I recover faster?"</strong></p>
            <p>"Hydrate consistently, prioritize sleep (7-9 hours), focus on protein for muscle repair, and listen to your body. We also offer mobility sessions and recovery clinics that can help. Recovery is just as important as training!"</p>
        </div>
