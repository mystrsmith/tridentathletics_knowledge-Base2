        <h2>🎯 COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES</h2>
        
        <h3>"I'm not fit enough for CrossFit"</h3>
        <p>"That's the #1 myth we hear, and it's completely backwards. CrossFit is designed to make you fit - you don't need to be fit to start. Our world-class coaches scale everything to your level. Every movement can be modified for any fitness level. Our most successful members often started as complete beginners."</p>

        <h3>"I'm intimidated by CrossFit"</h3>
        <p>"Totally fair concern. The truth is, our community cheers the loudest for beginners. You'll feel welcomed from day one. Our 'if you win, we all win' philosophy means everyone genuinely wants to see you succeed. The biggest 'intimidation' new members report is being overwhelmed by how supportive everyone is."</p>

        <h3>"I don't have time"</h3>
        <p>"Our workouts are just 60 minutes — in and out with maximum results. You'll save time compared to traditional gym routines because we handle all the programming. Our most successful members are often our busiest - CEOs, military personnel, working parents. You don't have time NOT to be fit."</p>

        <h3>"It's too expensive"</h3>
        <p>"Trident's value comes from world-class coaching and real results. Most members say it's one of the best investments they've ever made. Compare our world-class coaching, programming, and community to personal training ($100+ per session) or health problems. Most members spend less on Trident than they used to on ineffective gym memberships."</p>

        <h3>"I'm too old"</h3>
        <p>"We have members from teens to 70+, all fitness levels. You'll fit right in. Our Masters programs are specifically designed for athletes 40+ with modified programming for longevity and injury prevention."</p>

        <h3>"I have injuries"</h3>
        <p>"Our coaches are experts at movement modification and injury prevention. We focus on proper movement patterns before intensity. Many members come to us specifically for rehabilitation and safe progression."</p>

        <h3>"I don't know what CrossFit is"</h3>
        <p>"CrossFit is functional fitness - movements you use in real life, made more efficient and effective. Think squatting (getting up from a chair), lifting (picking up groceries), pressing (putting luggage overhead). It's intelligent, progressive training with world-class coaching, not random dangerous movements."</p>

        <h3>"I've heard CrossFit is dangerous"</h3>
        <p>"Under proper coaching, CrossFit is statistically safer than recreational running, basketball, or skiing. We have 16 years of safe training with thousands of members. More people get injured sitting at desks all day than training properly at Trident."</p>
