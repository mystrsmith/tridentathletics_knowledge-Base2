COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:

CROSSFIT EDUCATION:
Q: What is CrossFit?
A: CrossFit combines functional movements like lifting, running, and jumping into short, powerful workouts. Every session is coach-led and scalable to your level. It's constantly varied, high-intensity functional fitness that prepares you for anything life throws at you.

Q: Do I need to be in shape before starting?
A: Not at all! CrossFit is designed to be scalable to all fitness levels. Every workout can be modified to match your current abilities. Our experienced coaches will help you scale movements appropriately.

Q: Is CrossFit safe for beginners?
A: Yes, CrossFit is safe for beginners when taught by qualified coaches like ours. All movements are scalable, and proper form is emphasized over intensity. Safety is our top priority.

Q: How often should I do CrossFit?
A: For beginners, we recommend starting with 3-4 classes per week to allow your body to adapt and recover. More experienced athletes may train 5-6 times per week.

NUTRITION & RECOVERY:
Q: What should I eat before and after CrossFit?
A: Before: Light snack 1-2 hours before class - easily digestible carbs and small amount of protein. After: Consume protein and carbohydrates within 30-60 minutes post-workout to support recovery.

Q: How do I recover faster?
A: Hydrate consistently, prioritize sleep (7-9 hours), focus on protein for muscle repair, and listen to your body. Recovery is just as important as training!

SAFETY & SCALING:
Q: Can I do CrossFit if I have injuries?
A: Many people with injuries can safely participate in CrossFit with proper modifications. We recommend consulting with your healthcare provider first, then discussing your limitations with our coaches.

Q: What equipment do I need to start?
A: Just bring comfortable workout clothes, supportive athletic shoes, a water bottle, and a towel. All the equipment you need is provided at the gym.

MINDSET & PHILOSOPHY:

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Progress over perfection: Celebrate small wins and consistent effort
- Discipline creates freedom: Good habits lead to more choices and opportunities
- Choose the wrench: Embrace difficult challenges as growth opportunities
- Consistency beats intensity: Regular effort trumps occasional perfection

COMMON MINDSET COACHING:
"I'm too old for this." → Age is just a number! We have members in their 60s and 70s who are stronger and more mobile than people half their age. Progress at any age with smart training, proper nutrition, and adequate recovery.

"I'm not athletic." → CrossFit isn't about being naturally athletic - it's about becoming athletic. We build strength, coordination, and fitness from the ground up. Every athlete starts somewhere.

CROSSFIT TERMINOLOGY:
- WOD/Metcon: Workout of the Day / Metabolic Conditioning
- EMOM: Every Minute on the Minute
- AMRAP: As Many Rounds/Reps as Possible
- Rx vs. Scaled: Rx = prescribed workout, Scaled = modified version
- PR: Personal Record
- DOMS: Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness
- Olympic Lifts: Snatch and clean & jerk
- Gymnastics: Bodyweight movements like pull-ups, handstands
- Monostructural: Single-mode cardio like running, rowing, biking

MYTHS & TRUTHS:
- Myth: "Lifting makes you inflexible" → Truth: Full-range strength training improves mobility
- Myth: "Endless cardio burns the most fat" → Truth: Lifting builds muscle that increases daily calorie burn
- Myth: "Age means slowing down" → Truth: You can make progress at any age with smart training
- Myth: "Soreness equals progress" → Truth: Progress is consistency and performance, not soreness
- Myth: "Carbs are bad" → Truth: Quality carbs fuel training; timing and quantity matter
